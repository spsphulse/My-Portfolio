Last year, one of my broken earphones led me to write a Linkedin article when I had stumbled onto a notorious bot culture on Amazon. It received decent attention at the time. I thought about expanding on the project and doing similar analysis for other low-cost products. But as always, life happened, other things took over and I completely forgot about it.

I have been overwhelmed recently with multiple projects (at work as well as my own side-gigs). So I was looking for some way to manage everything. After finding that **'Getting Things Done(GTD) by David Allen'** was mentioned in multiple HN discussions as well as reddit posts, I decided to buy it on Amazon.

Typically, when I choose to buy books on Amazon, I look at both _Top reviews_ as well as _Most recent reviews_. Reasons are twofolds:
	1. Top reviews obviously speak for most of the people and give you a general sense if the book is really good or fluff(especially in this genre of productivity/self-help books
    2. Recent reviews to check if the book still hold relevance. A bunch of times I have found people complaining how recent edition of a book doesn't live up to expections. In that case, I'd rather buy the original print.
    
Hence, I went over to check recent reviews for GTD on amazon and was surprised to see the reviews. Here is a screenshot I took.

A couple of interesting things to note:
	- Barring that one review highlighted in green, all other reviews doesn not seem to be about the GTD book( or any book really)
    - Most of the reviews seem to mention about a hose or a flag.

That was it! That was enough for the serial procrastinator in me to abandon all of my other ongoing projects and start with this new analysis of reviews for GTD on Amazon. You see the irony here? Anyhoo, I promised myself I won't spend more than a couple hours on this. I just wanted to note down my cusrsory findings. Good enough topic for a first blog post,eh?
