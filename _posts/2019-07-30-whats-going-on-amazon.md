title: 'Whats going on, Amazon?'

Last year, one of my broken earphones led me to write a Linkedin article when I had stumbled onto a notorious bot culture on Amazon. It received decent attention at the time. I thought about expanding on the project and doing similar analysis for other low-cost products. But as always, life happened, other things took over and I completely forgot about it.

I have been overwhelmed recently with multiple projects (at work as well as my own side-gigs). So I was looking for some way to manage everything. After finding that **'Getting Things Done(GTD) by David Allen'** was mentioned in multiple HN discussions as well as reddit posts, I decided to buy it on Amazon.

Typically, when I choose to buy books on Amazon, I look at both _Top reviews_ as well as _Most recent reviews_. Reasons are twofolds:
1. Top reviews obviously speak for most of the people and give you a general sense if the book is really good or fluff(especially in this genre of productivity/self-help books
2. Recent reviews to check if the book still hold relevance. A bunch of times I have found people complaining how recent edition of a book doesn't live up to expections. In that case, I'd rather buy the original print.

    
Hence, I went over to check recent reviews for GTD on amazon and was surprised to see the reviews. Here is a screenshot I took.

A couple of interesting things to note:
- Barring that one review highlighted in green, all other reviews doesn not seem to be about the GTD book( or any book really)
- Most of the reviews seem to mention about a hose or a flag.

That was it! That was enough for the serial procrastinator in me to abandon all of my other ongoing projects and start with this new analysis of reviews for GTD on Amazon. Do you notice the irony here? Anyhoo, I promised myself I won't spend more than a couple hours on this. I just wanted to note down my cusrsory findings. Good enough topic for a first blog post,eh?

## Part 1 Scraping
I started by quickly scraping all the amazon reviews for GTD. Just used Python, Beautifulsoup & Requests. Nothing fancy. It consists of:
1.Finding total number of reviews for the book
2.Deciding number of review pages(total_reviews//10+1) and creating URLs to parse
3.For each URL, pare the reviews therein, create a final dataframe and store these reviews.

Jupyter notebook for the same can be found here.

## Part 2 Data processing and finding most frequent words
I did some preliminary cleaning of the reviews, chose the most recent 100 reviews and plotted the most commonly occuring words/tokens. The chart is shown below


Right off the bat, a few words that are highlighted in red jumped out as odd.Quite recently I had read a few articles on topic modeeling using NLP, but hadn't used it yet. I figured that could come in handy here to find topics that are not really associated with book/reading a book. That was my next & final step.


## Part 3 Topic Modelling
First I created a corpus and converted it to a document matrix using BOW(bag of words) approach in gensim. After that I trained an LDA(Latent Dirichlet allocation) model using the doc matrix. To understand a bit better, we visualize the results using pyLDAvis library. Especially stood out reviews with words like
-Hose
-Flag
-Metal
-Water
-Ponytail
-Coffee
-Nozzle
-Sturdy
-Barn
-Garden
-Plant


Finally just for funsies, I removed majority reviews indicating the GTD book using the following code(containing words such as david,author,GTD etc).

```python
df = pd.read_csv('GTD_Final_Reviews.csv',index_col=None)

book_indicators=['book','gtd','productivity','audible','david','allen','tasks','read',
                 'write','author','boring','information','system','plan','focus',
                'schedule','practice','busy']

#~(df.Comment.apply(lambda review: any(word in review for word in book_indicators)))
df = df[(~df.Comment.isnull())]
df = df[(~(df.Comment.apply(lambda review: any(word in review.lower() for word in book_indicators))))]
df.shape
```

Then I built an LDA model and just listed one of the cluster content. I think Amazon can do a better job of suprvising the comments on their products. Because otherwise, for example, how do I rely on that number of bloated reviews which are not at all related to the book. 

Just wanted to display one of the cluster contents here at the end. Have fun going through it. There's all kinds of weird things including hysterectomy(giggle giggle!)

Long cord, more than 3\' without any clumsy transformer and substantial round magnet, ~1" diameter, really holds it in place plus gooseneck makes a great light. Time will tell if it all holds together. No reason to doubt longevity at this point. Features and price can\'t be beat.',
