This is my first Jekyll blog post. I was finally able to merge a static site generator such as Jekyll with my pre-existing portfolio website(muchinlearning.com). Pheww!! I will try to put more content here as soon as possible. Untill then, please feel free to peruse the [portfolio website](https://muchinlearning.com/).


{% highlight javascript %}

function sayHello(name) {
  if (!name) {
    console.log('Hello World');
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
  }  
}  
{% endhighlight %}
